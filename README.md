## Software

- [x] Build a simulation
- [x] Add robots
- [ ] Add controllers to the robot to drive it using arrow keys
- [ ] Add a colour sensor
- [ ] Add a distance sensor
- [ ] Add a GPS sensor

Extras
- [ ] Control the robot using a simple grid search algo (without building a map of the env)
- [ ] Test some extreme cases: e.g. detecting collisions, getting a block from the wall
- [ ] Build a map of the env by detecting blocks using the distance sensor with GPS
- [ ] Use an algo (e.g. A* or Dijkstras) to find the best path to search for blocks
- [ ] Add a servo to the distance sensor to make it rotate to build a more accurate map
